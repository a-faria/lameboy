Electronics project: snake game running on Raspberry Pi Pico H

The goal for this project was to recreate the classic snake game from Nokia 3310

P.s: The case design is purposedly crude and lame, to not risk being sued by "you know who".

Next Features wishlist: <be>
* build a proper case (preferably with a less lame design)<br>
* score count and display<br>
* improved graphics for the snake and food
